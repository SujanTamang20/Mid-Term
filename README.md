Title and Meta Tags: I included a descriptive title and meta tags for character encoding and viewport settings. This ensures proper rendering and accessibility across devices.
External Fonts: Utilizing Google Fonts for Open Sans and Poppins is a nice touch. It enhances the typography and overall visual appeal of the webpage.
Separate Stylesheet: I have separated  CSS styles into an external stylesheet (style.css). This promotes better organization and maintainability in code.
Header: The header section with a clear title is well-structured and prominent, making it easy for visitors to identify the topic of the webpage.
Introduction: My introduction effectively explains the concept of Augmented Reality (AR) in a concise and understandable manner. It sets the stage for the rest of the content.
Images: Including relevant images throughout the content enhances understanding and engagement. Ensure images are appropriately sized and optimized for faster loading.
Structured Content: Breaking down the content into sections like "Introduction," "Applications in Education," "Benefits," etc., improves readability and allows visitors to navigate the page easily.
List Formatting: Using bullet points for listing the applications of AR in education and benefits makes the information more scannable and digestible.
Inspirational Quote: Adding an inspirational quote at the end adds a nice touch and reinforces the importance of technology in education.
Footer: The footer includes necessary information about the creator and copyright, along with a link for additional information on AR. Consider adding more details or links for better engagement, such as social media links or contact information.# midterm
