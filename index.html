        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Augmented Reality (AR) seamlessly integrates digital information into the real world,
             enhancing the user's perception and interaction with their environment.
             Through devices like smartphones, tablets, or AR glasses, virtual content 
             such as images, videos, or 3D models is overlaid onto the user's view of 
             the physical world in real-time. AR applications span diverse fields including gaming, 
             education, retail, healthcare, and architecture, offering immersive experiences and practical
              functionalities. Marker-based and markerless AR systems employ computer vision and sensor
               technologies to detect and track objects and surfaces, enabling accurate placement of virtual content. 
               Despite challenges like ensuring precise tracking and minimizing latency, AR continues to evolve, promising transformative experiences and redefining how we engage with information and the world around us.</p>
